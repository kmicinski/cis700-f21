## Student Support

Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I
invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or
accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your
success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) in this process.

If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register
with ODS, please visit their website at
http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.

ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic
accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access
plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and
generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon
as possible to begin this process.


## Student Mental Health

Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of
academic success. As such it is essential that during your college
experience you develop the skills and resources effectively to
navigate stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health
concerns. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the
Barnes Center provides (https://ese.syr.edu/bewell) and seek out
support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are
available 24/7, 365 days a year, at 315.443.8000.
